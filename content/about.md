## Who am I?

I am Hubert Mijalski based in Poznań, Poland, a Fullstack Developer with over three years of professional experience and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science.
 
I am mainly interested in C#/.NET, but I do not limit myself to other opportunities. I have experience working with the latest technologies in the .NET ecosystem, like Blazor or .NET6.
In addition, I have been working with JavaScript and frontend frameworks, like Angular or Svelte. I have created multiple online games with .NET servers and asynchronous communication realized with SignalR. I have experience creating SaaS applications and a big knowledge of the ASP.NET Boilerplate. I have aquired the AZ-900 certificate (Azure), but I also have experience working with other cloud providers (AWS, Heroku, Netlify).

I started my journey with programming at a very young age, when I used to make games in C++, and then after getting my first Android smartphone, I started creating games on that platform, with a good degree of success.	 

In high school I learned C#, to make games in Unity and that’s when I found out about .NET framework. At college, I got introduced properly to web development and self-thought myself JavaScript and CSS and started creating my first websites.

## Showcase

My Bachelor's Degree thesis, created in a group. The project allows uploading WASM algorithms to be calculated on other devices, allowing for at-scale computation to be done without any need for cloud providers. The client-to-server communication has minimal overhead and is highly scalable.

[DynamicCorsPolicy nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mijalski.DynamicCorsPolicy/) lets users change at runtime the allowed origins with small overhead (none if the origin is predefined at startup). The project was a small success, with its niche.
