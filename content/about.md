## Who am I?

I am Hubert Mijalski based in Poznań, Poland, a Fullstack Developer with over three years of professional experience and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science.
 
I am mainly interested in C#/.NET, but I do not limit myself to other opportunities. I have experience working with the latest technologies in the .NET ecosystem, like Blazor or .NET6.
In addition, I have been working with JavaScript and frontend frameworks, like Angular or Svelte. I have created multiple online games with .NET servers and asynchronous communication realized with SignalR. I have experience creating SaaS applications and a big knowledge of the ASP.NET Boilerplate. I have aquired the AZ-900 certificate (Azure), but I also have experience working with other cloud providers (AWS, Heroku, Netlify).

I started my journey with programming at a very young age, when I used to make games in C++, and then after getting my first Android smartphone, I started creating games on that platform, with a good degree of success.	 

In high school I learned C#, to make games in Unity and that’s when I found out about .NET framework. At college, I got introduced properly to web development and self-thought myself JavaScript and CSS and started creating my first websites.

## Showcase

My Bachelor's Degree thesis, created in a group. The project allows uploading WASM algorithms to be calculated on other devices, allowing for at-scale computation to be done without any need for cloud providers. The client-to-server communication has minimal overhead and is highly scalable.

[DynamicCorsPolicy nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mijalski.DynamicCorsPolicy/) lets users change at runtime the allowed origins with small overhead (none if the origin is predefined at startup). The project was a small success, with its niche.

[Hashash](https://www.hashash.app/) is a reddit clone. It's created with Svelte and .NET5.

Epicboost.eu was a website for League of Legends boosters and players. It featured login, registering, payments, live chat and tracking of orders. Written in ASP.NET Core.

[WorkPlanner](https://workplannerblazor.z6.web.core.windows.net/) started as a project that allows users to exchange time shifts at work. The server and dashboard was written using abp.io and Blazor. React Native was used for the consumer application. Sadly, it was not finished :(

I have also made multiple PhaserJS and Unity games, check them out:
